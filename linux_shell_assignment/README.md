Linux Shell Assignment – Basic Commands & Shell Scripts

This repository contains practical work completed for the
“Basics of Linux and Open-Source Tools” assignment.  
It includes Linux command outputs, three simple shell scripts,
and documentation.

Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to practice basic Linux operations,
command-line navigation, and simple automation using shell scripts.
This repository demonstrates:

- Directory and file management
- Process and system monitoring
- Basic networking tools
- Writing and running shell scripts
- Using GitHub for version control

The shell scripts included are intentionally kept simple to reflect
a beginner level of understanding.

1. backup.sh
A very basic backup script that asks the user for a folder name and

2. monitor.sh
Prints CPU and memory usage once using `top` and `free`.  
This avoids loops and advanced logic to keep it beginner-friendly.

3. download.sh
Prompts the user for a URL and downloads the file using `wget`.

Instructions for Running the Scripts

1. Open the terminal in the folder where the scripts are saved.

2. Give the script permission to run:
