Bond Price & Yield Calculator

A console-based Python tool that computes the fair value of a fixed-coupon bond, along with current yield and approximate Yield to Maturity (YTM). This project demonstrates core fixed-income valuation concepts used in Investment Banking, Quantitative Finance, and Capital Markets.

Key Finance Concepts Used

- Bond Price — Present Value (PV) of coupon cash flows + PV of face value
- Current Yield — Annual coupon income relative to bond market price
- Approx. YTM — Estimated internal rate of return of the bond

These are fundamental analytics performed by bond traders and analysts.

How to Run

bash
// navigate to project folder
 cd bond-price-yield-calculator

//run program (macOS/Linux/Windows with Python installed)
python src/bond_calculator.py
