Project overview

This mini‑project demonstrates the discounted cash flow valuation of a fixed‑coupon bond. 
It computes three key metrics:

Bond Price — the present value of future coupon payments and principal discounted at the market rate.

Current Yield — annual coupon divided by price, a quick income measure.

Approximate YTM — an approximation of the internal rate of return using a standard formula suitable for short exercises.

Intended audience: beginners in finance, students preparing for quantitative internships, or anyone learning fixed‑income basics.

Academic alignment: The implementation and documentation adhere to the assignment's layout requirements and the evaluation rubric,
                     encompassing concept understanding, implementation, real-world relevance, and innovation/effort.
