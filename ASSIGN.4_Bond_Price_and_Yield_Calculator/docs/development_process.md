Development steps:

#1. Designed formulas and confirmed financial definitions (coupon, discounting, current yield, YTM approximation).

#2. Implemented modular Python functions for price, yield, and YTM.

#3. Added input validation to improve usability.

#4. Wrote documentation (README + docs folder) and added placeholders for screenshots.

#5. Prepared Git commit plan and repository structure for GitHub hosting.

  
How this maps to real work:

Discounting cash flows is the core of valuation used in bond desks and IB pitchbooks. 
  The code is deliberately minimal to highlight the core financial logic while being fully reproducible.
