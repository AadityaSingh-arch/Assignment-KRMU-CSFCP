    <h1>Aaditya Singh</h1>
    <p>HI, nice to meet you, as it's stated in the heading I am Aaditya. This is my first web development lab assignment. I was told to make a simple webpage using HTML where I needed to give an introduction and talk about some interests of mine, so here we go.</p><br>

    <h2>About My Interests And Me</h2>
    <p>I am a computer science student which I am doing it to use it as a stepping stone so I can grab an opportunity to go and settle outside India. As for why i am doing Full stack? I myself do not have a good reason, it was told to me that it had high demand and package, but after studying it and diving further, I am having doubts about doing it, like I know that computer science is in demand but sitting at a desk for prolong period of time is not my cup of tea, I am thinking of switching to AI and Robotics. 
        <br>
    My main interest is in finance, like the flow of money, how do taxes work, how to reduce them, trade markets, stocks and all. My main reason for doing CSE is for parental comfort and their peice of mind, but still there is conflict in my family as my father wants me to go into defense line but i am not really interested. If they let me change my speacialization, i want to go into hardware tech and use the AI part for Fintech purposes. well that's about my career side of things, let us talk about me.<br>
    I am a what you call a typcal ambivert, i can be social when needed and i can be a loner when needed, i am not really into partying and all, i prefer staying at home and do what interests me. I am a multi-interest man, like if you start a conversation i can talk about anything from ghosts to every type of religion, from songs from kishore kumar to your modern pop but i don't really understand modern bollywood songs and haryanvi and punjabi music. I love to travel and explore new places, i want to go outside India and see how other countries are like. I also love to learn new things, like new languages, new cultures etc. well that's about me and my interests in a nutshell.If i really come out as an interesing person i am ready for a conversation but you have to initiate it as i am not really good at starting conversations or rather making new friends i can rather spend all my week alone than make new friends, well how can you blame anyone i was raised like that.<br>
     Hope you liked reading it as much as i liked writing it.<br>
    Thank you for your time and patience.
